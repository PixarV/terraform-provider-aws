# Resource: aws_iam_group_membership

Adds IAM users to an IAM group.

~> Use this resource no more than once per group to avoid inconsistent behavior.

resource "aws_iam_group" "group1" {
  name = "tf-group-1"
  type = "global"
}

resource "aws_iam_group" "group2" {

  type = "project"
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "user1" {
  name = "tf-user-1"
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "user2" {
  name = "tf-user-2"
}

resource "aws_iam_project" "project" {
  name = "tf-project"
}

resource "aws_iam_group_membership" "global-group" {
  name = "tf-global-group-membership"

  group_arn = aws_iam_group.group1.arn

  users = [
    aws_iam_user.user1.name,
    aws_iam_user.user2.name,
  ]
}

resource "aws_iam_group_membership" "project-group" {
  name = "tf-project-group-membership"

  group_arn = aws_iam_group.group2.arn
