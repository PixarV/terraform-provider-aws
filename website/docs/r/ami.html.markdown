# Resource: aws_ami

The AMI (Amazon Machine Image) resource allows you to create and manage images.

If you just want to share an existing image with another CROC Cloud account,
it's better to use [`aws_ami_launch_permission`][tf-ami-launch-permission] instead.

For details about images, see the [user documentation][images].

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an image that will start a machine whose root device is backed by
# an EBS volume populated from a snapshot. It is assumed that such a snapshot
# already exists with the id "snap-12345678".
resource "aws_ami" "example" {
  name                = "terraform-example"
  virtualization_type = "hvm"
  root_device_name    = "disk1"

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "disk1"
    snapshot_id = "snap-12345678"
    volume_size = 8
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

### Required Arguments

* `name` — A unique name for the image.
  * Required: Yes

### Optional Arguments

* `architecture` — Machine architecture for created instances.
  * Required: No
  * Default value: `x86_64`.
* `ebs_block_device` — An EBS block device that should be
  attached to created instances. The structure of this block is [described below](#ebs_block_device_block).
  * Required: No
* `ephemeral_block_device` — An ephemeral block device that
  should be attached to created instances. The structure of this block is [described below](#ephemeral_block_device_block).
  * Required: No
* `description` — A longer, human-readable description for the image.
  * Required: No
* `root_device_name` — The name of the root device.
  * Required: No
  * Valid values: `disk<N>` | `cdrom<N>` | `floppy<N>` | `menu` (`N` — disk number)
  * Default value: `disk1`
* `tags` — A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block][default-tags] present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
  * Required: No
* `virtualization_type` — Keyword to choose what virtualization mode created instances will use.
  * Required: No
  * Valid values: `hvm`

### Block Descriptions

<a id="ebs_block_device_block"></a>
The `ebs_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` — The device name of one or more block device mapping entries.
  * Required: Yes
  * Valid values: `disk<N>` | `cdrom<N>` | `floppy<N>`, (`N` — disk number)
* `delete_on_termination` — Boolean controlling whether the EBS volumes created to
  support each created instance will be deleted once that instance is terminated.
  * Required: No
` *iops` — Number of I/O operations per second the created volumes will support.
  * Required: Only when `volume_type` is `io2`
` *snapshot_id` — The ID of an EBS snapshot that will be used to initialize the created
  EBS volumes.
  * Required: No
  * Constraints: If set, the `volume_size` attribute must be at least as large as the referenced snapshot
* `throughput` — The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.
* `volume_size` — The size of created volumes in GiB.
  * Required: Required unless `snapshot_id` is set
  * Constraints: If `snapshot_id` is set and `volume_size` is omitted then the volume will have the same size as the selected snapshot.
* `volume_type` — The type of EBS volume to create.
  * Required: No
  * Valid values: `st2` | `gp2` | `io2`
  * Default value: `st2`

<a id="ephemeral_block_device_block"></a>
The `ephemeral_block_device` block has the following structure:

* `device_name` — The device name of one or more block device mapping entries.
  * Required: Yes
  * Valid values: `cdrom<N>` | `floppy<N>` (`N` — disk number)
* `virtual_name` — A name for the ephemeral device.
  * Required: Yes

### Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/blocks/resources/syntax.html#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` — Used when creating the image.
  * Default value: `40 minutes`
* `update` — Used when updating the image.
  * Default value: `40 minutes`
* `delete` — Used when deregistering the image.
  * Default value: `40 minutes`
